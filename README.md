## ðŸ¤” Why

The purpose of creating this script was to resolve cookie-related caching issues on amplify hosting when using nextjs

## âœˆ What is

The script is a middleware in the document.cookie getter and setter functions.  
It prevents the creation of new cookies by third-party scripts, while keeping them all saved in localStorage, maintaining the normal functioning of cookies on the frontend, including expirations.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

Some improvements that I intend to adjust:

- [ ] Add method to add and remove cookies without going through middleware, for cases such as authentication.
- [ ] Add ways to change the local-storage key name.
- [ ] Add way to set a safelist for cookies.
- [ ] Check operation on multiple websites and third-party scripts.
